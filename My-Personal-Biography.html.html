<p>Hi and hello there. First of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Noe Erni Binti Nazmi and I am 21 years old. I was born in Kulai, Johor but now I stay at Besut, Terengganu. How lucky I am to be in my big family which I have eight brothers and a sister. And of course I am the youngest. Since I was young, I love sports and too much in love with sports especially Muay Thai, Taekwando, Jiujitsu and other martial arts. Besides that, I also love to play handball. It is one of my favourite sport. My father support me if I want to learn martial art. But, different with my mom. She want me to learn cooking, sewing and others thing that other girl might love, but not for me. Since I was kid my father teach me to be rugged. And I love to be this way. Unfortunately, my mom did not like it so I have to left the things that I love. On top of that, I am just like the other girls who will crying while watching Korean drama. Yes, I surely love Korean drama a lot. As usually after watching Korean drama, I will tried my best to speak in Korean language. And congratulation to me when I can speak and understand a little bit in Korean language. But if my mom know that, I am dead! Next, my friends? Well, my circle is too small because I can not trust people easily. I only have one bestfriend that I fully trust. I called her Bella since her name is Nur Salsabila. I knew her since we are 13 years old. Back then, I do not like her because she is so annoying and I hate her. But who knows present day, she became to be my bestfriend. Like other people, I also has a dream where I want to make my parent proud of me and I want to repay them someday. I do not mind what kind of work I will have in the future as long as I can make my parent happy and can bring them to Mekkah. So that's all about myself. My biodata does not great as other people but I thankful and I love myself a lot :).</p>

<h1>Social Media</h1>
<p>There are a few social media that I usually used. The following are:<br>
<ul>
	<li> Facebook</li>
	<li>Instagram</li>
	<li>Snapchat</li>
	<li>Youtube</li>
</ul>

<p>The social media that I love the most and I frequently used is Facebook. Other people said, Facebook is such a dangerous social media. It is because of there are too many fake news, scammers and hackers. But in my opinion, Facebook is good social media where we can read latest news and information. Before we want to believe a news, we must investigate it first whether it is true or not and make sure before we share it to our news feed, we must know the news is true. On top of that, we also can do online shopping in Facebook since there are a lot of things that we can buy such as food, cloth and more.</p>
